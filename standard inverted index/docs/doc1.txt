Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming the modern world. From
self-driving cars to intelligent virtual assistants, AI systems are
becoming deeply embedded in daily life. Machine learning, a core
subfield of AI, enables computers to learn patterns from large datasets
without being explicitly programmed. As industries continue to
digitalize, AI applications in healthcare, finance, and education grow
rapidly, providing smarter decision‑making tools and increasing
automation. While AI offers remarkable benefits, concerns about ethics,
privacy, and job displacement continue to spark global debate.

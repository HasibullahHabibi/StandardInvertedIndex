Cybersecurity is essential in an increasingly connected world. With the
rise of cloud computing, mobile devices, and Internet‑of‑Things (IoT)
technologies, protecting digital assets has become more complex.
Cyberattacks such as phishing, ransomware, and distributed
denial‑of‑service (DDoS) have increased in sophistication. Organizations
must adopt stronger security practices, including encryption,
multi‑factor authentication, and continuous monitoring. Cybersecurity
professionals are in high demand as companies work to safeguard
sensitive data and maintain trust in digital ecosystems.

Machine learning (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence focused on
building systems that learn from data. Supervised learning models use
labeled datasets to make predictions, while unsupervised models discover
hidden patterns within raw data. Reinforcement learning allows agents to
learn optimal actions through rewards and penalties. ML algorithms are
widely used in fraud detection, recommendation systems, natural language
processing, and image recognition. As technology evolves, ML has become
a foundational component of intelligent systems across multiple
industries.
